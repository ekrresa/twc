# FAQs

## Can I use it without Tailwind CSS?

Yes, even if `react-twc` has been created to solve Tailwind + React productivity, it is not linked to it. It creates class based components, so you can perfectly use it without Tailwind.

## Does it supports props interpolations?

No, props interpolations are not supported. I tried to make this utility as small as possible and I don't see a real advantage over passing the function at the top level.

## What are the differences between other libraries like `styled-components`?

`react-twc` is not a simple port of `styled-components` for classes. I tried to create it with today's practices and to keep it as small as possible. I added some very useful features like the support of `asChild` or the ability to specify your own compose function.
